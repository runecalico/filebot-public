1.2.4

1.2.3
- Switch AniDB Romanisation case statements to use returnAniDBRomanization method instead

1.2.2
- Adjust 3rd rename attempt for Absolute files using TVDB (Too many incorrect matches)

1.2.0
- Fixed issue where 3rd pass would always run instead of the few cases when it *should* run
- Added Individual File Renaming to 2nd Pass RFSPartial Rename, except when useNonStrictPartialRenames is true
- Since Individual File Renaming works VERY well, I defaulted the 1st pass to ALSo use Individual File Renaming 
  - Added useIndividualFileRenaming option (Default true) which can turn that off if desired
  - Using IFR dramatically improves matching when strict=true, as well as it seems to also reduce false matches in *some* instances
- Added skipMovies option (default false) to allow skipping movie renaming.
1.1.0
